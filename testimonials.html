            <p class="first-Text">"Seth was beyond helpful in responding when our Wifi went down.  He responsed quickly, and was able to get it up quickly with minimal impact
                on our business.  He explained everything to us that he was doing, and was understanding even when I was stressed.  We would have been in trouble had we not
                been in business with Maloney's IT Consulting."

            <p class="second-Text">"Seth is a life saver, I know my way around an oven, but anything technology is another language to me.  Seth was able to come in, and
                explain everything in my shop, and what it does.  That way if something ever breaks, I can troubleshoot it myself!  The other IT Consulting businesses around
                here would have laughed me off if I asked them to explain anything, but not Seth!  I wholeheardly suggest Seth for your IT needs!"

            <p class="third-Text">"I don't know where I would be without Seth.  No one thinks about IT until something breaks, and when something breaks, it is always at the 
                worst time!  I was waiting on a very important call with investors from Australia, when all of a sudden, my computer died!  I called the other big IT Consulting
                places around here, and they all gave me three hour windows, I tried to explain that I needed help now, but all they said was it was an extra fee!  I called Seth 
                expecting to get the same answer, but instead, he said he was on his way over!  No extra fees, no window of time for him to show up.  I wasn't even a customer of 
                his when I called, and he still came right over.  You bet I'm a customer of his now!"
