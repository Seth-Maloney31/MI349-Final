        I believe one of the most important things when it comes to providing good, quality service is knowing who works for you.  My name is Seth Maloney, and I am a graduating
        student from Michigan State University (Go Green!)  I have worked in Iformation Technology for over five years, starting when I was an intern at Delta Dental and working
        my way up to On-Site IT support at Greif's Mason Plant, the largest manufacturing plant that they have.  I am in the National Guard, and have deployed to Syria.  I'm 
        confident if I can setting up the network in Syria, that I can fix any network or computer issues that you have.

        A lot of the larger IT companies in the area will give you "Consulting Options" where they want to make you pay a monthly fee for them to come out and fix your issues, 
        but come time that something has broken, they say, "We will be out there from the time of 4-6."  How does that help when your main way of checking out customers with a 
        card is down, and you're losing money every minute that the device is down?  I will give you an exact minute that I will be there, and whether the device goes down at 6AM
        or 11PM, I will be there with a smile on my face and I will put your issues first and foremost.  The best part?  You only pay me when something breaks.

        I stayed in the field of Information Technology because I love to help people.  I love the sigh of relief from a nervous employee who was freaking out that their 
        computer went down right before a big presentation, and I get it up with time to spare.  I love having my employers call me reliable, and know that when they need me, 
        I will fix their IT issues.  From being up in a scissor lift trying to find Wifi Access Points to troubleshooting why the printer won’t print, I’ve seen it all.  
        You have enough to worry about being a small business, let me worry about the technology.
